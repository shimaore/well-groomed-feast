Voicemail Application for FreeSwitch
====================================

This is a rewrite of the [CCNQ3](http://ccnq.shimaore.net/) Voicemail Application using the newer [esl](https://github.com/shimaore/esl/) API.
The backend is still CouchDB, used both for provisioning and for message (audio) storage.

Dependencies:
`bumpy-lawyer` for config generation
